I have created a website named Homeland where people can buy and
sell flats online with 100+ designs. They can be able to customize their
homes as per their requirement by contacting to the designers online.
They can also able to share their views. I am also going to provide them
the refer and earn option and many more features including real time
customer care feature.I have also added the admin feature where user can perform different PostgreSQL queries at admin level.
